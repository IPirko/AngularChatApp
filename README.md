# Angular: Creating Firebase Chat Web App
This is my thesis, made in Angular version 9.1.7. As a database, I use Firebase Real Time Database.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

[Firebase] (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
